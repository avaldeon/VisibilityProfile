The plugin creates images that show the profile of the terrain between two points (the observer and the target) taking into account the height of both elements. In addition, it adds the direct lines of sight between the elements, as well as the line of sight of the highest angle ground, so that the proportion of the visible element observed is displayed. Finally, the graph is filled in 3 colors to indicate within the line of sight, if the observed object is displaced, if at each point the element would be seen in its entirety (the ground is seen), if it is partially seen, or if it is not seen.
You need as source layers a DEM raster and a point layer with a field "tipo_punto" with 0 if it is the observer or 1 if it is the target
